Hi!

You can find all the projects as executables here.

You will not be able to preview them, download the files.

This should give you a sense of what you could be aiming for, and maybe even extensions later.

You will not be able to see the code behind the scenes, as these are not .py files.

Good luck with your projects,
Viv
