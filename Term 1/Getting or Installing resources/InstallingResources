Hi, welcome to the coding Club's Github Page.

You'll see many resources here like this one.

In case you didn't quite finish installing everything in the session, here is how to so you can do it at home:

----------------Let's begin---------------------

*Getting Python*
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest python version for your OS (Windows on school laptop)
3. Open the installer, and keep clicking 'Next' and 'Install'. I have checked, there is nothing you need to change, unless you really want to.
4. It should install. Good job.

*Getting VS Code*
5. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download
6. Download latest VS Code version (I think it should Auto-Download when you go to the site).
7. Navigate through this installer, again clicking 'Next' until done.
8. Install, and open! You have now installed VS Code.

*Setting Up VS Code*
You haven't configured it yet, so we will make it usable now.

9. In the main window, it should give you a start preferences option.
10. I'd say go with the default preferences (dark mode) and other stuff.
11. When you're happy, click 'Mark as done'.

12. Now, go to extensions tab on left-most side of the window. It looks like 3 squares together and 1 square a bit off.
13. Get the python extension (and I recommend to get the Python debugger and pylance too).
14. Make a folder in your normal files, like in Downloads where you can easily access and remember.
15. In your current VS Code workspace, open that folder!
16. Make a python file - {name_of_the_file}.py. Make sure to end in .py otherwise you create a text file.

Good job. You now have gotten Python and VS Code, so you can continue on with the course!

P.s. If coding at home, I'd recommend you get Pycharm instead of VS Code, as it is much better, and easier to use. If you do, get the community edition!
